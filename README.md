# Beeping Docs

## Overview
This repository contains the official documentation site for the Beeping ecosystem, built with Docusaurus and TypeScript.

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 18
- npm

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Local Development
- Start the dev server with `npm run start`.
- Open http://localhost:3000/ to view the site.
- Changes in docs and source files trigger hot reload so you can iterate quickly.

## Production Build
- Build the static site with `npm run build`.
- The optimized output is emitted to the `build/` directory.
- The build runs strict checks; broken links or markdown errors fail the build.

## Documentation Navigation
The sidebar is autogenerated from the filesystem configuration in `sidebars.ts`. Each section uses `_category_.json` files to set titles, positions, and ordering, ensuring consistent navigation without manual sidebar edits.

## Development Workflow
- Make small, focused changes.
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the site passes strict checks.
- Review locally with `npm run start`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes.
- Commit manually after verification.

## CHANGELOG Policy
- Follow the Keep a Changelog format.
- Record all changes under the `[Unreleased]` section until a release is cut.
- Entries are never deleted; history remains intact.
- Versions are tagged later when releases are prepared.
