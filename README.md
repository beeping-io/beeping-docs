# Beeping Docs

## Overview
Official documentation site for the Beeping ecosystem, built with Docusaurus and TypeScript.

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 18
- npm

## Install
- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Run locally
- Start the dev server with `npm run serve`.
- Open http://localhost:3000/ to browse the docs.
- Edits to docs and source files hot-reload automatically.

## Build
- Create a production build with `npm run build`.
- The output is written to `build/`.
- Broken links and markdown issues fail the build for safety.

## Navigation note
The sidebar is autogenerated from filesystem metadata in `sidebars.ts`, with `_category_.json` files controlling titles, positions, and ordering.

## Workflow
- Make small, focused changes.
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the site passes strict checks.
- Review locally with `npm run start`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-visible changes.
- Commit manually after verification.

## Testing and validation
- `npm run test` must pass before every commit; it runs all checks below.
- `npm run test:docs:structure` ensures required documentation sections exist and each has an `index.md`.
- `npm run test:docs:content` validates frontmatter and a Markdown H1 on every `index.md`.
- `npm run test:docs:i18n` checks that Spanish docs mirror the English structure for all `.md` files.
- `npm run test:build` performs a production build to catch broken links and markdown issues.
- For i18n verification, always run `npm run build` followed by `npm run serve` to preview the production output; `npm run start` is for fast local dev only.
