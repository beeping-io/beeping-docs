# Contributing to Beeping Docs

## Local setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run start` and open http://localhost:3000/ to preview changes with hot reload.

## Validating changes
- Run `npm run build` before sharing work; broken links and markdown issues fail the build.

## Required checks
- Run `npm run test` before any PR or commit; this runs docs structure/content/i18n checks plus the production build.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for every user-visible change.
- i18n rule: every doc under `docs/**` must have a Spanish counterpart once i18n is enabled.

## Languages
- English is the source of truth for all documentation under `docs/**`.
- Spanish docs must exist under `i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/**` with matching paths.
- PRs that add or modify docs must update both English and Spanish versions.
- Every English doc must include a link to `/es/docs/...`, and every Spanish doc must link back to `/docs/...`.

## Translations
- UI pages under `src/pages` must wrap user-facing strings with `<Translate>` (with stable ids).
- When adding or changing UI text, update the Spanish translation JSON under `i18n/es/**` for the matching ids.
- Always record user-visible text changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.

## Where docs live
- Documentation content is under `docs/*`, organized by sections such as `introduction`, `protocol`, `beepbox`, `sdk-android`, `sdk-ios`, `core`, `examples`, `community`, `projects`, `crowdfunding`, and `contact`.
- `_category_.json` files inside sections control titles and ordering in the autogenerated sidebar.

## Style guidelines
- Write in clear, concise English.
- Keep steps actionable and scoped; prefer small, iterative changes.
- Align new pages with existing section structure and sidebar metadata.

## Pull request process
- Ensure `npm run test` passes locally.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for all user-visible changes.
- Provide a short summary of what changed and why.
- Submit the PR once ready for review.
